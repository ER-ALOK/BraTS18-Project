## Brain Tumor Segmentation
Noninvasive methods of brain imaging, most commonly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are routinely
used to identify and locate tumors in the brain. Currently, brain tumor image segmentation is a 
time consuming practice which must be performed manually by medical professionals. As such, with
the recent emergence of effective computer vision methods, notably convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs), there is significant practical value in using these tools to automate and improve the 
accuracy of segmentation. We propose using capsule networks to perform segmentation of brain 
tumors in MR images.
